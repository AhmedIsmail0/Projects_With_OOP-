Programming Language used: C++ 

Step 1

The metro lines in a city shall be digitally simulated.
The number of metro stations on each different metro line is to be entered flexibly at the beginning.
The stations of a line shall be stored as a doubly-linked list from a start to an end station.
A metro train travels from the start to the end station and back again.
Starting from an initial state where a metro train stopped at the first station of a line, it is to be simulated and output where the metro train is after
1, 2, 3, ... minutes.
For simplicity, in the simulation each stop at a metro station is to last one minute, and the journeys from one station to the next are to take one,
two, three, four or a maximum of five minutes.

Step 2 

The metro stations are to be extended to include information on transfer connections of passengers as well as the total travel
time in minutes for a complete outward and return ride of a metro line.
